	"description": "Righting naming wrongs. On several of the biggest sports media websites, this extension will replace the corporate-sponsored names of stadiums, arenas, and bowl games with their original and better-known names. This is not even close to complete so, if you don't see something that you think should be here or would like to see this extension work on a different site, please leave feedback and I'll be happy to add it.",
